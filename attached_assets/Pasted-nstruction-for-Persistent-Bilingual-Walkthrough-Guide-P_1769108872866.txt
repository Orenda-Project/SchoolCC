nstruction for Persistent, Bilingual Walkthrough Guide:

Please implement an in-app, always-accessible walkthrough/help guide for my app—one that’s much more than a one-time onboarding tour. Here’s what I need:

Persistent Access:
Add an always-visible “Help” or “Guide” icon/button (e.g., a "?"/lightbulb/floating button) on every screen in the app.
When the user taps it, show a step-by-step, context-aware guide for that screen or feature (similar to onboarding, but available any time—before or after account creation).
Feature-by-Feature Tours:
Each major interface (create account, home, dashboard, each main button, and every unique role) should have its own mini-guide, not just a catch-all tour.
If the user is on “Create Account,” show guide steps for every field/option.
On dashboard or after login, highlight all primary buttons/menus, with a short guide for each (e.g., “This is the role selector. Tap here to choose your role.”).
Persistence:
Make the guide re-openable anytime; even if dismissed, can be reopened by tapping the help/guide icon.
Track if the user has never viewed a guide, and auto-prompt at least once—but never force-cover any button/input as before.
Bilingual:
Every guide step must offer both default language (English) and one alternative/local language (e.g., Urdu or [specify other language]).
User should be able to tap a “Language” toggle on the guide itself to instantly see translations and tips in either language.
Design/Accessibility:
Bubbles/tooltips/banners should be short, mobile-fit, never cover key features, and scroll or shorten as needed on small screens.
Show brief, 1–2 line tips, icons, and visual anchors (arrows, highlights) for each feature.
QA:
Demo this on both “Create Account” and at least two other key interfaces.
Send screenshots (mobile and desktop/tablet) showing the guide open/visible and language toggle active for each main feature/button.
Summary:

I want an in-app guide that’s always there, not just for onboarding. Every feature and role should have context help, accessible in two languages, and never block critical actions.
Users should always be able to re-open or peek at help from any interface.
