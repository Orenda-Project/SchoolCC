Area	Indicator	Emerging (1)	Developing (2)	Proficient (3)
Classroom Environment	The classroom fosters open discussions and critical thinking.	Discussions are teacher-dominated with minimal student input. Example: Students answer only factual questions without follow-up.	Some encouragement for discussions, but student participation is limited. Example: Students share ideas, but few questions are asked to probe deeper.	Open discussions are encouraged, with students freely sharing and debating ideas. Example: Students discuss multiple solutions to a problem collaboratively.
	Resources and space are organized to support collaboration and problem-solving.	Resources and space are disorganized, limiting collaborative learning. Example: No designated group work areas or materials for problem-solving tasks.	Some organization, but space/resources do not fully support collaboration. Example: Materials are present but not effectively used for group activities.	Resources and space are well-organized for collaborative tasks. Example: Tables are arranged for group work, and materials are easily accessible.
	Students are actively encouraged to participate in complex tasks with clear expectations.	Students are given basic tasks without clear expectations. Example: Instructions are vague, and students struggle to engage in complex activities.	Some students engage in complex tasks, but expectations are not consistently clear. Example: Instructions lack clarity for all groups.	Students actively participate in complex, clearly defined tasks. Example: The teacher assigns roles for group problem-solving and explains expectations.
Lesson Planning	Lesson objectives explicitly link to critical thinking, problem-solving, or creative skills.	Objectives are vague or focused on rote learning. Example: "Understand the topic" with no reference to critical thinking or problem-solving.	Objectives mention higher-order skills but lack detailed alignment with activities. Example: "Analyse the text" without clear support for the analysis.	Objectives are explicit and linked to HOTS. Example: "Evaluate the author's argument and create your counterpoint with supporting evidence."
	Lesson plans include strategies for promoting analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.	Strategies focus on recall and comprehension. Example: Activities ask for definitions but no analysis or synthesis.	Some activities promote analysis or synthesis but lack variety or depth. Example: Students analyse a passage but do not synthesize ideas.	Strategies explicitly foster HOTS, including evaluation and synthesis. Example: Students compare arguments and propose their solutions based on evidence.
	The lesson integrates interdisciplinary or real-world applications.	Lessons are taught in isolation without real-world relevance. Example: Math concepts are taught with no application.	Some connections to real-world or interdisciplinary themes, but not fully integrated. Example: Mentioning real-world examples without exploring them.	Lessons integrate real-world applications and interdisciplinary links. Example: Students use math to design a sustainable business model.
Instructional Strategies	The teacher poses open-ended and thought-provoking questions.	Questions are mostly close-ended, requiring one-word answers. Example: "What is the capital of France?"	Some open-ended questions are asked, but they lack depth. Example: "Why is the capital important?" without encouraging further exploration.	Open-ended, thought-provoking questions dominate the lesson. Example: "How would you redesign this city to make it more sustainable?"
	Instruction actively involves students in analyzing, interpreting, and critiquing content.	Students passively receive information. Example: The teacher explains a text without student critique.	Some analysis and critique are encouraged, but it is not consistent. Example: Students are asked to analyse but not interpret or critique.	Students actively analyse, interpret, and critique content. Example: Students critique a historical argument with supporting evidence.
	The teacher demonstrates problem-solving and creativity in real-time scenarios.	Simple tasks are demonstrated without explanation of the problem-solving process. Example: "This is the solution," without steps.	Problem-solving is modeled, but the teacher does not explain strategies. Example: "Let me solve this quickly for you."	Problem-solving and creativity are modeled with clear strategies. Example: The teacher brainstorms solutions and explains the reasoning behind choices.
	Scaffolding is used effectively to help students explore complex ideas.	Minimal or no scaffolding is provided. Example: Students are asked to solve problems independently without guidance.	Some scaffolding is provided, but it is inconsistent. Example: The teacher provides hints but does not guide students through complex steps.	Effective scaffolding supports student exploration. Example: The teacher provides step-by-step guidance and gradually reduces support as students improve.
Student Engagement	Students collaborate on tasks requiring synthesis, evaluation, or innovative problem-solving.	Collaboration is minimal or absent. Example: Students work individually without interaction.	Some collaboration occurs, but tasks lack depth. Example: Students share ideas but do not work towards a synthesized solution.	Collaboration is structured and focused on synthesis and problem-solving. Example: Students work in teams to design a solution to a community problem.
	The teacher encourages students to explore multiple perspectives or create novel solutions.	Content is presented from a single perspective. Example: Students are taught one method without alternatives.	Multiple perspectives are mentioned, but exploration is limited. Example: The teacher describes perspectives but doesn't encourage student evaluation.	Students actively explore and evaluate multiple perspectives. Example: Students debate solutions and propose creative alternatives to a problem.
	Students actively engage in discussions and debates on complex topics.	Discussions are teacher-led with limited student involvement. Example: The teacher talks, and students answer briefly.	Some discussions and debates occur, but only a few students participate. Example: A few students contribute to a debate while others stay silent.	Discussions and debates actively involve all students. Example: Students collaboratively debate and refine their arguments in a group setting.
Assessment & Feedback	Students engage in self-assessment or peer-assessment to evaluate reasoning and solutions.	Assessment is limited to teacher-led grading. Example: Students receive a grade without reflecting on their performance.	Some self- or peer-assessment occurs, but it is inconsistent. Example: Students assess each other's work but without clear criteria.	Self- and peer-assessment are structured and purposeful. Example: Students use rubrics to assess their work and suggest improvements for peers.
	The teacher provides feedback that guides students in refining reasoning or solutions.	Feedback is generic and not actionable. Example: "Good job" or "Try again" without specifics.	Feedback is specific but does not consistently guide improvement. Example: "You missed this part; try to include it."	Feedback is specific, actionable, and focused on improvement. Example: "Your argument is clear, but adding evidence will make it stronger."
	Assessment tasks require students to analyse, evaluate, or create based on the lesson content.	Assessment tasks focus on recall and do not involve higher-order thinking. Example: Quizzes with factual questions only.	Some tasks involve analysis or evaluation but lack depth. Example: "Write a short analysis" with limited criteria for success.	Assessment tasks consistently require analysis, evaluation, or creation. Example: "Develop a project that evaluates and improves this system."
